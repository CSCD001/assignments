\section{Introduction}
Over the years COCIS has had a problem of issuing out examination permits on time.
\section{Problem Statement}
We want to solve this problem so that students get their permits a week before the examination timetable is displayed.

During the examination period, students find it difficult to get their permits and those that persevere and get theirs, find issues with them; either an outstanding balance or with missing registered course units.

If we don't deal this problem more resources may be wasted say in hiring more staff to help with correcting and issuing out permits and students also stand at risk of missing exams.
\section{Conclusion}
A problem well stated is half solved, Wally Davis taught me that one.  And he's right, the better the clarity around what the team is attempting to fix, the more efficient they'll be in solving the problem.

Examination permits should be issued out on release of the final copy of the examination timetable.
